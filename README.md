This year, weâ€™re focusing our efforts on the social safety net, collectively working to improve access to food, housing, healthcare and more. At its roots, National Day of Civic Hacking is about using our people power to maximize impact in our communities. With your input and participation, we can continue to effectively respond to and rebuild from the COVID-19 crisis we face.
